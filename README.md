# Currency Exchange

Automatically exchanges emblems for you from a higher emblem value to a lower emblem value.  
This window will open automatically when you visit Usuri Brightcoin.

## Example

For instance if you want 20 Hero, and have 5 Conquest, 5 Valor, and 10 Triumph. 
This addon will do all the purchasing for you so you can simply type 20 and hit the Hero icon.
Specifically it will buy 10 Triumph, then 15 Valor, then 20 Conquest to get the amount you want.
